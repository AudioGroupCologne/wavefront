<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

Wavefront is a two dimensional acoustic wave simulation application utilising the TLM (transmission-line matrix) method.

It is designed to be a tool for educational purposes developed by students of the [University of Applied Sciences Cologne](https://www.th-koeln.de/), allowing users to experiment with different acoustic scenarios and observe the effects of different parameters on the wave propagation.

It can be used to simulate point sound sources in a free field.
